		Recreational Investigations into Systems Programming

	<h2>
		Welcome to my blog!<br>
		I'm a computer science undergrad at UPenn with a passion for low-level programming.<br>
		My reasoning for starting this website is to bookkeep methods I'm inventing and technologies I'm learning!<br> 
		I'm excited to share my findings with you and demystify parts of the computer one-by-one.<br>
