Hi! I'm David Yang and I enjoy digging into coding computer systems and architecture, so I decided to document them publicly here!

I am certain to make mistakes and choose misguided reasonings for certain topics, but if that happens don't hesitate to let me know. My target audience is primarily people my age still primarily studying computer science, to whom I want to encourage to test and run the code we're shown in class.
Anybody who is interested in the questions I'm asking though is greatly appreciated and any feedback is too!

Have a wonderful day :)
